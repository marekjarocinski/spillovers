The variables explained:

For the definition of Monetary Policy and Central Bank Information shocks and the motivation of the sign restrictions see:

The source data for the construction of these variables:

The source data are the financial market "surprises" measured around the times of the ECB monetary policy announcements.
They come from the Euro Area Monetary Policy Database of  Altavilla et al. (2019). JME
https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/annex/Dataset_EA-MPD.xlsx

Based on this database we first construct
pc1eon1_me - the 1st principal component of the Monetary Event- 
             window changes in overnight index swaps (OIS) with maturities 1-, 
             3-, 6-months and 1-year (Identifiers: OIS1M, OIS3M, OIS6M, OIS1Y); 
stoxx50_me - Monetary Event-window changes in the Euro Stoxx 50;
and based on them we construct the shocks.

The content of the different .csv files:

..._d.csv - daily shocks
..._m.csv - monthly shocks, sum of the daily shocks in each month (or zero if no shocks in this month)
..._q.csv - quarterly shocks, sum of the daily shocks in each quarter
