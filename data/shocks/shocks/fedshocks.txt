Variable names:

MP_pm,CBI_pm - Monetary Policy and Central Bank Information shocks obtained
               with Poor Man's sign restrictions.

MP_median,CBI_median - Monetary Policy and Central Bank Information shocks obtained
               with the median rotation that implements the sign restrictions.

The variables explained:

For the definition of Monetary Policy and Central Bank Information shocks and the motivation of the sign restrictions see:

The source data for the construction of these variables:

The source data are the financial market "surprises" measured around the times of the FOMC announcements, obtained as the sum of the surprises around the press releases and the surprises around the press conferences.
The surprises around the press releases come from the dataset of Gurkaynak, Sack and Swanson (2005) updated until June 2019 by Gurkaynak, Karasoy-Can and Lee (2021) and available in their replication files at \url{http://www.bilkent.edu.tr/~refet/GKL_replication.zip}.
The surprises around the press conference come from the Thomson Reuters Tick History dataset. I thank Jonas Jensen and Georgios Georgiadis for their help with extracting these variables.

Based on this dataset we first construct
pc1ff1 - surprise in the "policy indicator", ie 1st principal component of
         the surprises in interest rate derivatives with maturities
         from 1 month to 1 year (MP1, FF4, ED2, ED3, ED4)
sp500 - surprise in the S&P500
and based on them we construct the shocks.

The content of the different .csv files:

..._d.csv - daily shocks
..._m.csv - monthly shocks, sum of the daily shocks in each month (or zero if no shocks in this month)
..._q.csv - quarterly shocks, sum of the daily shocks in each quarter
