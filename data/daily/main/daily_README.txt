This data represents the Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) of the ICE BofA 
AA US Corporate Index, a subset of the ICE BofA US Corporate Master   
Index tracking the performance of US dollar denominated investment    
grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. 
This subset includes all securities with a given investment grade     
rating AA.                                                            
The ICE BofA OAS are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS    
index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury     
curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, 
weighted by market capitalization. When the last calendar day of the  
month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a
result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.

This data represents the Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) for the ICE BofA
Emerging Markets Corporate Plus Index                                 
(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLEMCBPITRIV?cid=32413), which  
tracks the performance of US dollar (USD) and Euro denominated        
emerging markets non-sovereign debt publicly issued within the major  
domestic and Eurobond markets. To qualify for inclusion in the index, 
the issuer of debt must have risk exposure to countries other than    
members of the FX G10 (US, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Canada,     
Sweden, UK, Switzerland, Norway, and Euro Currency Members), all      
Western European countries, and territories of the US and Western     
European countries. Each security must also be denominated in USD or  
Euro with a time to maturity greater than 1 year and have a fixed     
coupon. For inclusion in the index, investment grade rated bonds of   
qualifying issuers must have at least 250 million (Euro or USD) in    
outstanding face value, and below investment grade rated bonds must   
have at least 100 million (Euro or USD) in outstanding face value. The
index includes corporate and quasi-government debt of qualifying      
countries, but excludes sovereign and supranational debt. Other types 
of securities acceptable for inclusion in this index are: original    
issue zero coupon bonds, "global" securities (debt issued in the US   
domestic bond markets as well the Eurobond Market simultaneously),    
144a securities, pay-in-kind securities (includes toggle notes),      
callable perpetual securities (qualify if they are at least one year  
from the first call date), fixed-to-floating rate securities (qualify 
if the securities are callable within the fixed rate period and are at
least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond          
transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security). Defaulted      
securities are excluded from the Index.                               
ICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:     
Index constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current 
amount outstanding. With the exception of US mortgage pass-throughs   
and US structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is  
calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for US      
mortgage pass-through and US structured products is calculated        
assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are  
received during the month are retained in the index until             
the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. 
Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the    
Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, 
based on information available up to and including the third business 
day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the   
qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month.
Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month
remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which     
point they are removed from the Index.                                
                                                                      
The ICE BofA OASs are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS   
index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury     
curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, 
weighted by market capitalization. When the last calendar day of the  
month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a
result of month ending accrued interest adjustments. When the last    
calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated spreads
between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category  
and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each     
constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. The ICE    
BofA High Yield Master II OAS uses an index of bonds that are below   
investment grade (those rated BB or below).                           
This data represents the ICE BofA US High Yield Index value, which    
tracks the performance of US dollar denominated below investment grade
rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To    
qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have a below      
investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and     
Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an     
average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term         
sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year  
of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount  
outstanding of $100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds,        
"global" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US
domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities,   
including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable  
perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from 
the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify   
provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at    
least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond          
transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and
defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.

received during the month are retained in the index until the end of  
the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does  
not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The   
Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on   
information available up to and including the third business day      
before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the       
qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month.
Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month
remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which     
point they are removed from the Index.                                
                                                                      
When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend,

This data represents the Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) of the ICE BofA 
Euro High Yield Index tracks the performance of Euro denominated below
investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the euro domestic  
or eurobond markets. Qualifying securities must have a below          
investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and     
Fitch). Qualifying securities must have at least one year remaining   
term to maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount       
outstanding of Euro 100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds,    
"global" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and   
euro domestic markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities,   
including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable  
perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from 
the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify   
provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at    
least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond          
transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. Defaulted,      
warrant-bearing and euro legacy currency securities are excluded from 
the Index.                                                            
                                                                      
ICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:     
Index constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current 
amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs 
and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is
calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S.    
mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated      
assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are  
received during the month are retained in the index until             
the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. 
Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the    
Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, 
based on information available up to and including the third business 
day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the   
qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month.
Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month
remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which     
point they are removed from the Index.                                
                                                                      
The ICE BofA OASs are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS   
index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury     
curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, 
weighted by market capitalization. When the last calendar day of the  
month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a
result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.

Data for the period prior to 1994 come from the working paper "A New  
Federal Funds Rate Target Series: September 27, 1982 - December 31,   
1993" (Thornton, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 2005,             
http://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/2005/2005-032.pdf). Due to an error 
in the paper values from April 2, 1986 - April 20, 1986 were adjusted 
manually to 7.3125%. Data from 1994 to the present are derived from   
FOMC meeting transcripts and FOMC meeting statements,                 
http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/.                                  
                                                                      
Effective December 16, 2008, target rate is reported as a range.

The Chicago Fed's National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) provides 
a comprehensive weekly update on U.S. financial conditions in money   
markets, debt and equity markets and the traditional and "shadow"     
banking systems. Positive values of the NFCI indicate financial       
conditions that are tighter than average, while negative values       
indicate financial conditions that are looser than average.

The breakeven inflation rate represents a measure of expected         
inflation derived from 5-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Securities   
(BC_5YEAR) and 5-Year Treasury Inflation-Indexed Constant Maturity    
Securities (TC_5YEAR). The latest value implies what market           
participants expect inflation to be in the next 5 years, on average.  
Starting with the update on June 21, 2019, the Treasury bond data used
in calculating interest rate spreads is obtained directly from the    
U.S. Treasury Department
